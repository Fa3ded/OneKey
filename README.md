# OneKey
## v3

This is a project that I am working on to not only get better at 3d design, Python (no longer used), and C++, but it is also somthing I used to get better at GitHub. Feel free to leave a pull request if you have an improvment!

# Required Hardware:
##THE PRINTABLES 3D FILES ARE NOT MINE.
###The directly linked files are

* [Seeeduino Xiao](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html)
* Key Switch
* Any Keycap that fits
* Small thin wires

# Quick Rundown:
###I made it way simpler:
*Print parts
*Assemble
*Solder
*Upload
*Ur good to go!

  ## Email me with any questions or if you would like to collaborate to make this startup project even better!
